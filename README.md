## WPF MVVM Medical App 
---
Application for automating medical record keeping hospital records. 

Data Base - Access (it was an accident.)


This is my term project, if anyone finds this useful in any way, feel free to take it and use it. 


Database and everything else is there, for the application to work you just need to change the path to the database everywhere. YES I KNOW that it could have been set once and passed everywhere, but I was stupid and didn't even think about it, so it is as it is. 


Also, you may need to mess around in the Configuration Manager to start the project, as I understand it is caused by the use of Access database, but since I have succeeded, so will you, if you try. 

I will also discount the document, explanatory note, on which I wrote for the defense of this project.
